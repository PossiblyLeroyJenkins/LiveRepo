Project File For Trading Bot

There are no API Keys or Credentials here.  This will work for anyone*, once they add their own API Keys.

This is a trading bot for MEXC API.  I already know the code is trash, I do not care, because it works.  If you can do better, go do better.  If you need code that just works to start building your own, feel free to use anything here for free.  No credit needs to be given, and I will deny I wrote this spaghetti monstrosity if you try to tell anyone you got it from me.

Good luck, Charlie Brown.

* As long as you are using the same python version I wrote this in with standard libs.  As of this writing, it is 3.13.5 and I am running 2024.3 Kali Rolling.  Yes, I know.  I'm using Kali because it's what can run on this box.  Kali will run on a potato, if you look at the potato right.  I assume a contemporary version of Ubuntu will run this code just as well, provided you are using the same python version.  Because holy shit do I have python.  I wish it wasn't the best language for this.  But it is.  So.
